# Sales Data Dashboard

Developed an interactive sales data dashboard for Big Fashion Group to analyse and visualise sales performance across multiple dimensions. The dashboard provides insights into total sales by states, managers, categories, and chains. 

** Key components include:  **

- Sales Trends: Tracks sales over time across chains (Fashion Direct and Next Look).
- Sales by Category: Breaks down performance into product categories like Mens, Shoes, and Home.
- Sales by States: Visualizes regional performance on a map and trends for each state.
- Sales by Manager: Highlights contributions of individual managers.
- Filters: Users can filter by Financial Year, State, and Category for dynamic insights.
